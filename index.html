        <h2>Top 5 Co-op Games</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Published: Sept 2025</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Overcooked! 2</strong> – chaos in the kitchen  
            <br>
            Overcooked! 2 pushes your friendships through the hottest culinary pressure imaginable.  
            Simple controls trick you into a false sense of security before the game turns into a
            high-speed kitchen fire drill with teleporting portals, moving trucks, and airborne kitchens.
            Communication becomes the superpower that decides whether you serve soup or set the universe ablaze.
            No matter how messy the orders get, the laughter never stops.
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            <strong>It Takes Two</strong> – award-winning teamwork adventure  
            <br>
            This game is pure creativity bottled into a co-op experience.
            Every level introduces fresh mechanics that keep your jaw on the floor:
            talking garden tools, time manipulation puzzles, and epic boss fights that feel straight out of Pixar.
            The narrative follows a couple learning to fix their relationship
            through miniature adventures that are funny, heartfelt, and occasionally brutal
            to your communication skills. Zero filler. Pure joy.
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong> – mine and survive together  
            <br>
            Space dwarves. Beer. Explosions. Perfect.
            Each mission drops your squad into dark procedural caves crawling with alien bugs.
            You must dig paths, gather resources, escort mules, and
            survive ambushes while shouting “Rock and Stone” like
            a cult anthem. Class synergy matters: the Scout lights the darkness,
            the Driller creates shortcuts, the Engineer builds defenses,
            and the Gunner holds the line. A brilliant loop of chaos and camaraderie.
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            <strong>Left 4 Dead 2</strong> – classic zombie survival  
            <br>
            This legend still delivers unmatched tension and replayability.
            The AI Director adapts every session to your performance:
            if you’re doing too well, a Tank shows up to ruin your evening.
            Working together becomes the only path to survival as special infected attack
            with unpredictable timing. The game doesn’t care about your feelings…
            it only cares about separating you from your team and eating your face.
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            <strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong> – retro beatdowns  
            <br>
            A modern tribute to arcade brawlers that punches with style and nostalgia.
            Hand-drawn visuals look like a comic book in motion,
            backed by a soundtrack that slaps harder than Axel’s uppercut.
            Friendly fire is always on so teammates become accidental punching bags,
            but that’s part of the charm. Perfect for short sessions that still feel epic.
